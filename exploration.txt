setup:
 - robot at starting point with 4 cameras towards each direction


1. CONSTRUCT map based on current recordings
    - clip at max_ray_length + EPSILON
2. RUN skeleton expansion
    - find black and white vertices
    - identify frontiers
    - find center of polyhedron
3. GOTO center of polyhedron
    - maybe CONSTRUCT map and MERGE
4. check RayWalking paths towards potential frontiers
    - select frontiers achieveable by RayWalking
    - store valid frontier in FIFO
5. pick valid frontier from FIFO
    - CONSTUCT map around frontier center
    - MERGE and try node expansion
6. if new node is achieveable by RayWalking
    - start expansion as in 1. from there
